USE INSTRUCTIONS
----------------
If you simply want to use this tool you can download the executables
located either in bin/x86-nt/ or in bin/x86-linux/. Note that both
sets have been compiled for 32bit operation, meaning that vocabularies
sizes of 2^32-1 can be accomodated. In practical terms this means you
can compile language models with vocabularies of more than 2^16-1
words.

The Windows version tool has been compiled for native execution.

We *strongly* recommend that you use only the ASCII file
formats. There is no longer any benefit to the binary format and we do
not intend to actuvely support it.


DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------
The software is organized using the Gnu Autobuild environment, so you
should be able to compile for other architectures or purposes. For
example, if you need the old version of the tool, you need to
recompile. The following should do it:

./configure
make install

If you are on a Windows machine you will also need to have Cygwin
installed (with the developer components).

configure supports one tool-specific options:

--enable-mingw 
>> on Windows only, does a native compilation; otherwise you will be 
   compiling for cygwin only.
